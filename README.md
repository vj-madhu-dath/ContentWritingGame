# ContentWritingGame (Inspired from https://www.chrisfoxwrites.com/5000-words-per-hour/)
A Python script that gamifies writing and editing

## Usage
Run the script. It will give you three options:
1. Writing
2. Editing
3. Exit

### Option 1: writingGame
* Enter the number of minutes you want to write.
* Enter the topic.
* Start writing
* Read the word count, words per hour, and press enter
* Look at the chart and close it
* Enter yes to play the game again

### Option1: editingGame

* Enter the minutes you want to edit the file generated with option 1.
* Start editing from top to bottom.
* Know the words per hour to edit words you have not touched.
* Enter yes to play the game again.

### Option3: Exit
Exits the game.

## Points to Note
* Both the games save the files as markdown. The writing also includes words per hour and the time stamp.
* The plot will show the time stamp, the words per hour, and the duration. T
